# gif-thingy
A thingy to load up a GIF for copying to the clipboard, so you can paste it in a chat.

1. Put your GIFs in the "gifs" directory
2. Type the name of the .GIF you want to load (without the extension) into the form on index.html.
3. Click enter and your GIF appears on the page!

This project gave me some good practice with:
- Arrow functions
- Event listeners
- Setting attributes
- Template literals
- Query selectors
- Form submit and the preventDefault function
